# Coming SOONish: DIY Pedals Directory

<span class="valueprop">A one stop shop for all things DIY pedals.</span>

### What's the goal?

We're making a guided tour for newcomers to the hobby, and a one-stop-shop for all things DIY Pedals for everybody else.

People don't know what they don't know, so this site makes pedal building **discoverable**.



### And what form will it take?

Specifically this is going to be a **DMOZ style directory of curated and categorized links** in an organized hierarchy. There may be some original content spread throughout as well.



### Can't I just "google it?"

Sure, you can.
*IF* you know exactly what you're looking for. And if you're willing to parse through low quality garbage "content" created to play the Search Engine Optomization game for ad revenue. Great and timeless articles get buried by the algorithms for being "stale."

 

A directory makes knowledge **browsable**, and **discoverable**. For a niche hobby like DIY guitar and bass pedals this can be invaluable, especially if we add commentary to each link helping you contextualize what you'll find there.



### What's the catch? What's your angle? <insert skepticism here>

None. This is primarily a **passion project** because the community will benefit from it. We believe it will help provide a welcoming introduction to the hobby for newcomers, as well as be a continued central resource veterans will visit again and again.



That said... Some of the categories in the link directory are specifically lists of vendors. If you want to see a list of sites where you can buy pedal PCBs, we'll have that here as well. We ([MAS Effects](https://mas-effects.com)) sell a handful of useful and niche products for DIY pedals, and if this site helps bring more people into the hobby it will also bring us more potential customers. However we WILL ABSOLUTELY list all reputable vendors, and it won't just be a listing of our products. We believe that **rising tides lift all boats**.



This is going to be a win for everyone, most of all people looking for anything related to DIY pedals.



### Open source, volunteer project

Collecting, categorizing, and curating links is a big job. Visitors to the site will be able to submit new links, corrections, and updates. But we also need volunteers to help populate and maintain the site through the admin section of our Content Managmenet System. If you're interested, please feel sign up below!



The entire directory (all the data files, links, categories, etc) will be freely available on Github for posterity. Because this is a community effort, we want to ensure 100% of the fruits of this labor are available freely to all.
